excerpt: 'To address the performance limitations and scarcity of annotated data in cross-center bone tumor X-ray detection caused by imaging variations, we propose a domain-adaptive detection framework incorporating multi-layer feature alignment, Wasserstein distance evaluation, instance-level feature alignment, and consistency regularization modules. By designing an attention-based domain discriminator that effectively bridges domain disparities, the model achieves average precision improvements of up to 2% and 10.7% on source and target domain test sets, respectively. This approach holds promise for resolving generalization challenges in multi-center scenarios.'
